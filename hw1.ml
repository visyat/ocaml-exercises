(** 5. Russell's Paradox â€“ this is impossible in OCaml. 
Expressions of type 'a list cannot in turn be composed of their own type 
(recursively, with no base type 'a). The resulting error will be produced: 
"This expression has type 'a but an expression was expected of type 'a list. 
The type variable 'a occurs inside 'a list"
